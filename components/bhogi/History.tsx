          History & Origin

          Bhogi originates from ancient agrarian life in South India, marking
          the transition from winter to the arrival of brighter, warmer days. It
          was traditionally dedicated to Lord Indra, the god of rains, to ensure
          a bountiful harvest.

          <br />
          The centerpiece of the festival is the sacred bonfire, the Bhogi
          Mantalu. Burning old belongings in this fire is a powerful spiritual
          symbol: it represents releasing the weight of the past, clearing away
          negativity, and creating space for renewal and hope.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over time, Bhogi has evolved from a purely agrarian ritual into a
          joyous celebration of community, blending prayers, music, and
          togetherness to welcome new beginnings.
